     For improving the website and serving ads, we use third party solutions. As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Akamai, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Firebase, OneSignal, PubMatic, Sendios, Sentry, Criteo, LiveRamp. Therefore, some of the data is stored and processed on the servers of such third parties. This enables us to (1) analyze different interactions (what articles our users viewed); (2) serve and measure ads (and show them only to a particular group of users, for example, only to those, who clicked on certain type of advertisement)
